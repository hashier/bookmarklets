bookmarklets
============

Some small bookmarklets which may help you. 


DuckDuckGo
----------

Simple script that asks you what you want to look for. If you have marked anything on the page this word is automatically added as the search string. This script can be useful on an iPhone if you put the script under "Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts". Now you only have to type the shortcut into the address bar of your browser and hit enter.
